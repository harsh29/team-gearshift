One of the biggest challenges in FLL is designing attachments that can complete multiple missions quickly. Here's our approach.

## The Problem

We need to complete 15 missions, but we can only attach 3-4 tools to our robot at once. How do we maximize our mission count while keeping attachments simple?

## Our Strategy

1. **Multi-function attachments:** One attachment does 2-3 missions
2. **Quick-change system:** Attachments swap in under 5 seconds
3. **Simplicity first:** Complex mechanisms break under pressure

## The Claw Design

Our main attachment is a motorized claw that can:

- Pick up small mission models
- Push larger objects with precision
- Hold objects while driving

We went through 7 iterations before finding the perfect balance of strength and speed. Each version taught us something new about gear ratios and structural integrity.

### Design Evolution

**Version 1:** Too weak - couldn't hold objects  
**Version 2:** Too slow - took 5 seconds to close  
**Version 3:** Too bulky - hit other mission models  
**Versions 4-6:** Incremental improvements  
**Version 7:** Perfect! âœ…

## Key Design Principles

### 1. Gear Ratios Matter

We learned that:
- **Speed:** Use small gear to large gear (1:3 ratio)
- **Torque:** Use large gear to small gear (3:1 ratio)
- **Balance:** Find the sweet spot for your mission

Our claw uses a 2:1 ratio - enough torque to grip firmly, but fast enough to complete missions quickly.

### 2. Structural Support

LEGO connections can be surprisingly weak under stress. We reinforced our claw with:
- Cross-bracing on long beams
- Multiple connection points
- Strategic use of axles vs. pins

### 3. Testing, Testing, Testing

We test each attachment 20+ times to ensure reliability. If it fails even once, we redesign. In competition, we only get one chance!

## The Quick-Change System

Our attachment mount uses a simple pin-based system. Key features:

- **Alignment guides:** Ensures perfect positioning every time
- **Color coding:** Red = left side, Blue = right side
- **Practice makes perfect:** Our team can swap attachments in 3 seconds!

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simple is better** - Our most reliable attachment is also our simplest
2. **Document everything** - We take photos of each iteration
3. **Team input matters** - Great ideas come from everyone
4. **Fail fast** - Test early, fail fast, learn quickly

## Next Steps

We're currently working on:
- A precision pusher for small missions
- A dual-function arm for two mission zones
- A backup set of all attachments (just in case!)

## Photos

*(In a real blog, you would add photos here)*

- Build team working on the claw
- All 7 iterations side-by-side
- The quick-change mount system
- Success! Completing a mission

**Fun Fact:** Our claw attachment is nicknamed "The Lobster" because of its bright red color and pincer design. ðŸ¦ž
