The first step in any FLL season is understanding the game. Here's how we broke down this year's challenge.

## Mission Analysis

We created a spreadsheet ranking all 15 missions by:

- **Points:** How many points is it worth?
- **Difficulty:** How hard is it to complete reliably?
- **Time:** How long will it take?
- **Dependencies:** Does it need to be done before/after other missions?

## Our Scoring Matrix

| Mission | Points | Difficulty | Time (sec) | Priority |
|---------|--------|------------|------------|----------|
| Mission 1 | 40 | Easy | 15 | HIGH |
| Mission 2 | 30 | Medium | 20 | HIGH |
| Mission 3 | 50 | Hard | 25 | MEDIUM |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Strategic Priorities

### High Priority Missions (Must Complete)
These missions offer:
- High point value
- High reliability
- Low time investment
- Early board position

### Medium Priority Missions (Nice to Have)
These missions are:
- Moderate points
- Decent reliability
- May require special attachments

### Low Priority Missions (If Time Allows)
These missions are:
- Lower points OR
- Very difficult OR
- Far from other missions OR
- Require complex attachments

## Our Strategy

Based on our analysis, we decided to:

1. Focus on 8-10 high-value, reliable missions
2. Leave the super difficult missions for later if we have time
3. Plan 3 autonomous runs of 2.5 minutes each
4. Build in buffer time for unexpected issues

## The Math

Our target is 350+ points. Here's how we'll get there:

### Run 1: Foundation Missions (120 points)
- Mission 1: 40 points
- Mission 2: 30 points
- Mission 5: 25 points
- Mission 6: 25 points
- **Estimated time:** 1:45
- **Buffer:** 45 seconds

### Run 2: High Value Missions (140 points)
- Mission 3: 50 points
- Mission 4: 35 points
- Mission 7: 30 points
- Mission 8: 25 points
- **Estimated time:** 2:00
- **Buffer:** 30 seconds

### Run 3: Bonus Missions (100 points)
- Mission 9: 40 points
- Mission 10: 35 points
- Mission 11: 25 points
- **Estimated time:** 2:15
- **Buffer:** 15 seconds

**Total:** 360 points (with safety margins!)

## Risk Management

### What Could Go Wrong?

1. **Robot malfunction** - We have backup programs
2. **Mission models shift** - We practice field setup
3. **Battery dies** - We have fresh batteries ready
4. **Attachment breaks** - We have duplicates
5. **Program bug** - We test 100+ times

### Contingency Planning

If something goes wrong during a run:
- Have a "safe return" program to get robot back to base
- Switch to backup programs for remaining runs
- Stay calm and encourage each other
- Remember: It's about learning and improvement!

## Field Mapping

We divided the field into zones:

- **Zone A (Home):** Where robot starts
- **Zone B (Easy):** Close, high-value missions
- **Zone C (Medium):** Moderate distance missions
- **Zone D (Far):** Distant missions, high risk
- **Zone E (Expert):** Most difficult missions

## Path Planning

### Run 1 Path
```
Home → B1 → B2 → C1 → Home
```

### Run 2 Path
```
Home → B3 → C2 → C3 → Home
```

### Run 3 Path
```
Home → D1 → D2 → C4 → Home
```

## Key Insights

1. **Reliability > Points:** A 30-point mission you complete 100% of the time is better than a 50-point mission you complete 50% of the time

2. **Position Matters:** Missions near each other should be done in the same run

3. **Time is Precious:** Every second counts - plan efficient paths

4. **Practice Varies:** Test on different field setups to handle variations

## Team Decisions

After analyzing the challenge, we voted on:

### ✅ What We're Definitely Doing
- Missions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
- Focus on reliability and consistency
- Simple, proven strategies

### ❓ What We're Considering
- Missions 3, 10, 11
- Depend on attachment development
- Will decide after testing

### ❌ What We're Skipping (For Now)
- Missions 12, 13, 14, 15
- Too complex for our experience level
- Not enough time/point value
- Can revisit if we have extra time

## Next Steps

1. **Week 1-2:** Design robot base and first attachment
2. **Week 3-4:** Program Run 1 missions
3. **Week 5-6:** Build remaining attachments
4. **Week 7-8:** Program Runs 2 and 3
5. **Week 9-10:** Test and refine everything
6. **Week 11-12:** Practice, practice, practice!

## Lessons from Last Year

Our returning team members shared wisdom:

> "Don't overthink it. Start with simple solutions and improve gradually." - Sarah, returning programmer

> "Test on a real field, not just on the floor. The mat makes a difference!" - Mike, returning builder

> "Make sure everyone understands the strategy, not just the leaders." - Emma, returning captain

## Innovation Project Connection

Our challenge analysis also helps our Innovation Project research! We're looking at how the missions relate to real-world problems and using that to guide our project development.
